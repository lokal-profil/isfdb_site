/* 
   insert_reference.sql is a MySQL script intended to add
   new reference sources to the reference list. This version will 
   add Bleiler78, OCLC and some extra Primary verification options.

   Note that Currey and Primary (Transient) are expected to have been 
   fixed first (via scripts/fix_reference_list.sql 1.1).

   It is only supposed to be run ONCE so protection against 
   inserting duplicates is built in. Note when creating new versions
   that you will have to keep the reference IDs in step in each insert,
   and do not attempt to create reference_ids that already exist.
