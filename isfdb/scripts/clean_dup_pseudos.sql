/* 
   clean_dup_pseudos.sql is a MySQL script intended to clean up
   duplicate entries in the pseudonyms table, i.e. where an author has 
   been made the pseudonym of the same other name more than once.
   It does this simply by deleting the higer-numbered pseudo_id row, so
   may need running multiple times to clear all duplicates.
   It can be run as necessary until whatever bugs allow such 
   duplicates to be created have been fixed.
